==========Global Notes==========
- I have created main.ipynb file for running a program populating requested outputs
- main.py file is importing pumping_cycle_utils.py file, where all functions get getting the results are stored
- all functions and steps should be well commented in .py file in order to understand the applied logics


==========Task Solution Description==========
A) Cycle Treshold
- program is printing out mean treshold value
- program is showing chart with timestamp on X-axis and pressures on Y-values accross all detected pumping cycles


B) Cycle Trend Health Hypothesis
Approach:
- I have decided to apply a hypothesis testing for each of the detected pumpingy cycles
	- Hypothesis was defined as:
		- Null Hypothesis H0: no trend exists
		- Alternate Hypothesis Ha: decreasing trend exists
	- For detecting a trend I have used correlation calculating (using Kendall’s Tau)
	- For statistical tests I have used p-value

Results: 
Kendall’s Tau values for all pumping cycles are indicating quite strong negative correlations (around -0.8).
These values are also confirmed by p-values (for 95% confidence interval) results, which are all < 0.05.
Therefore we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the initial assumption, that pump is "healthy" as the pressure is gradully decresing during all of the pumping cycle periods.
