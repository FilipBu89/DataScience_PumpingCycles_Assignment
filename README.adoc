= Pumping Events Detection

Detect pumping cycles.
Calculate and visualize the health of the pump using the data from the cycles.

== Input

The link:Pressure.csv[Pressure.csv] file contains the following columns:

- _Date_ - timestamp of the row
- _Pressure_ [Pa] - actual pressure in a vacuum chamber
- _PumpState_ [Enumeration] - actual state of a pump

Each row of the file represents one logging.
The _PumpState_ values are logged only when the pump changes its state.
Until then, the previous logged state is valid.
The _Pressure_ is logged irregularly and only when a pressure measurement is performed.

== Algorithm Assigment

The *pumping cycle* is defined as followed:

- starts 10 seconds after the _PumpState_ changes its value to pumping (1)
- ends 5 second before the _PumpState_ changes its value to pumped (2)
- there are no changes of _PumpState_ during the cycle (but some additional pumping = 1 values may be logged during the cycle)

=== A) Cycle Threshold

Calculate the *cycle threshold* (minimal _Pressure_ value) for each cycle.
Finally, calculate the mean of the cycle threshold values.

=== B) Cycle Trend Health Hypothesis

Consider the following pump health hypothesis.
If the pump is healthy, the _Pressure_ should gradually decrease during the pumping cycle.
Check whether the data match the hypothesis.
Use any approach and visualization means to perform the check.
(The hypothesis testing is a possible solution but is not required.
Simple "common sense" approach is perfectly OK.)

=== Requirements and Tips

Use pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) package to solve the assignment.

We suggest to use http://jupyter.org/ as a development tool. So the solution can be in form of Jupyter notebook. However regular .py file will work as well. 

== Output

. Visualize all the cycle threshold values using time as x-axis
. Visualize the cycle trend health analysis results
. Commit all your code and results back to the repository
